Hi, I’m @Deborah-Morris, formerly Arthur-Morris
If you are from my old job or anywhere else I wasnt explicitly out, I hope this isnt a big suprise. I kept meaning to say something and then just didnt. I will explane when we next meet.

I’m interested in mathamatical computing/ backend development
I dont use GIT a ton for personal stuff, most of this is just old junk from school.
